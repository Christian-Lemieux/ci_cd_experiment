# ci_cd_experiment

This simple project will be used as a test of common CI/CD methodologies. I have no experience with these sorts of technologies so it'll serve as a testing/learning ground for me along the way.

The goal is to find a way to reliably and easily deploy the latest code of a project to the shared nxj-dev environment so developers won't need to reach out to someone like Khoa / Lei to make that happen. Automated testing is also something I feel is lacking from our web applications so I plan to also incorporate something like Selenium.

Coming into this, my intent is to use the following technologies:

- CodePipeline
- CodeDeploy
- Jenkins
